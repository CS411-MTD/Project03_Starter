## Getting Started

### 1. Set Up Python Virtual Environment (Optional)
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate        # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Run Your Classifier
```bash
python app.py
```
This executes `app.py` to train on `data/train.csv` and evaluate on `data/test.csv`.

## Project Guidelines

Please read **[Project_Guidelines.md](Project_Guidelines.md)** carefully before starting. It covers:
- **AI Policy & Declaration:** Allowed vs. prohibited AI use; mandatory PETRA AI Student Declaration (`AI_declaration.png`).
- **Dataset Preparation:** 100 positive and 100 negative sentences (80/80 train, 20/20 test); AI generation of data is strictly prohibited.
- **Algorithm Specifications:** Bag-of-words counting, class priors, Laplace smoothing, log-space scoring, and tie-breaking rules.
- **Video Presentation Rubric (30 marks):** 5–7 minute video recording walkthrough (no written report).
- **+30% Non-English Language Bonus:** Guidelines and interview booking link for non-English language submissions.

## Submission Instructions

Submit all files listed in the directory structure (including `app.py`, `data/train.csv`, `data/test.csv`, `video_link.txt`, `AI_declaration.png`, and `requirements.txt`) to **Gradescope** under **Project 3**.

For complete requirements and the evaluation rubric, refer to [Project_Guidelines.md](Project_Guidelines.md).
